# TODO
- Revisit FontFactory? Why is it not an interface like the others?
- Separate out moth_ui stuff some more. Focus on the graphics interface without moth_ui then add a layer that adds ui support

- Refactor image handling.
    - Introduce image atlas type (texture?)
    - Images can be (texure?) or a sub section of the (texture?)
    - Will probably require refactoring the moth ui stuff and texture packing stuff.
